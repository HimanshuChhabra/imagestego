Image Steganography is an ability of concealing information inside the cover image in such a way it looks like a simple cover hiding the fact of existence of a secret information.Algorithm developed focuses on first Encrypting the secret message using AES and then embedding the cipher within greyscale cover image.
The project was developed in the year 2014-2015 as a part of Thesis project of my bachelors degree . Extensive research was done on steganograohic techniques.
New algorithm was developed which proved to surpass existing embeding techniques in image spatial domain.
Kindly go through the SDH.pdf , it completely describes the technique and algorithm developed.
